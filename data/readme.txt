Behavioural data (n=35 participants)
The response was collected sporadically. 
Seq refers to the stimulus intensity (1=low, 2=high)
rt refers to the reaction time in seconds
gen_p1g2 and genp2g1 are the generative (true) transition probabilities of the stimulus sequence (p(L|H) and p(H|L) respectively)
prob-pxl is the pixiel coordinate of the subject rating on a visual analog scale, which is then used to calculate the rated probabilities:  
    obs_p1: rated p(Low)
    obs_p2: rated p(High)
    obs p1g2: rated p(L|H)
    obs(p2|g2): rated p(H|H)
    obs p2g1: rated p(H|L)
    obs p1g1: rated p(L|L)
Runtime is the stimulus sequence running time in seconds
